# Apex

### What is Apex?

**Apex** is the frontend interface for **Subnet 1**, giving users access to our LLMs in a way that feels similar to leading centralized and open-source tools.

Apex goes beyond simple chat , it supports web-retrieval, chain-of-thought, reasoning, and combined results from multiple miners.
