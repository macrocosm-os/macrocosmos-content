#### **Create a New Task**

You might be interested in building an app that tracks public reactions to new tech launches.\
Lets say Vision Pro, Pixel, or the latest MacBooks.\
You want live posts from Reddit and X.

**Step 1:** Name your task. For Example:\
&#xNAN;**`TechNews Tracker`**

**Step 2:** Specify your data source, or scrap from both!\
`Reddit`or `Twitter (X)`

**Step 3:** Define your keywords.\
Tell Gravity what to find.

For X, try hashtags like:\
`#VisionPro` , `#MacbookAir` , `#Pixel8,` `#AppleEvent`

For Reddit, specify relevant subreddits such as:\
`r/technology`, `r/Apple`, `r/GooglePixel`, `r/gadgets`



#### Mission Commander&#x20;

Mission commander , our specialized AI assistant can also help provide the relevant keywords for you task, all you have to do is ask! Mission commander is powered by [subnet-1-apex](../../subnets/subnet-1-apex/ "mention")



**Step 1: Write a request**&#x20;

Start by telling MC what type of data you'd like to collect&#x20;

**Step 2. Ask to Correct the Labels (Optional)**

If the labels aren't quite right, you can edit manually or ask mission commander to fix it. For example, We didn't include any labels on iPhones . Let's update that
