Other top labels include `p383_54249`, `sid_data_universe`, `angeldark7665`, and `alexdrocks`, each accounting for **1–2%** of the total.

These labels reveal **who is most active** in the conversation around “validator". If `rhef` is showing up in 3% of the 53,854 data points, that suggests this user is a **key voice** in validator related discussions.

Spotting spikes or dips in post activity can reveal community reactions to network events



#### Sentiment: How Do People Feel About Validators?

The sentiment line graph shows how the **emotional tone of the conversation** shifts over time, based on automatic sentiment labeling.

The **purple (negative)** sentiment appears more intense and variable, with frequent spikes below the zero line.

The **green (positive)** sentiment holds steady across the year, with a few upward bumps.

The frequent negative sentiment spikes may correspond to community frustration, perhaps validator downtime, or performance concerns. The steadier positive sentiment may reflect ongoing support from core contributors and validators doing well.



By combining all three, you can:

* Identify key influencers or repeat contributors
* Investigate time-specific sentiment spikes
* Track the lifecycle of community conversations over months

This view is especially useful for community leads, researchers, and validators themselves who want to monitor their reputation or respond to emerging concerns.&#x20;
