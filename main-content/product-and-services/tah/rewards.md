# Rewards

## How Rewards Are Calculated
Rewards are primarily based on:
- The amount of tokens you contribute during training.
- How many times you contribute your model weights back to the network.
- Additional factors such as uptime, quality, and current network parameters.

Note: Exact weighting can evolve as the system updates.

## Payout Cadence
- Payouts occur approximately every 24 hours; this window may be extended in the future.
- Minimum payout is **2 ALPHA**. Balances below the threshold roll over to the next payout.
- Network transfer costs are deducted from the amount you receive.
- To receive payouts, optionally connect a wallet by pasting your public coldkey (via the **Connect** button in the app). If you don’t connect, training still runs but rewards won’t be delivered to you.

## Viewing Earnings
- In the app, click the **Miner** button (top left) to view your current earnings and contribution stats.

## Taxes & Compliance
- You are responsible for complying with local tax and regulatory requirements related to rewards.
