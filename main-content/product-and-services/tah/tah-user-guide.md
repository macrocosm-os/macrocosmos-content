# TAH User Guide

Training at Home (TAH) application allows you to connect and partake in our decentralized AI training platform [IOTA](../../subnets/subnet-9-iota/). You can plug in any hardware you have access to and earn rewards for powering decentralized AI model training.&#x20;

We aim to solve one of the biggest challenges in open-source AI today: the absence of a decentralized, community-driven, and highly efficient pre-training platform.&#x20;

Today, access to large-scale compute is concentrated in a few organizations, limiting innovation and slowing progress across the ecosystem. By enabling anyone to contribute hardware and collectively train powerful models, we lower the barrier to participation, unlock underutilized global compute, and empower a wider community of builders and researchers. This creates a more resilient, transparent, and scalable foundation for advancing open-source AI — one that grows stronger as more people join and contribute.

## Installation

To become a first beta tester of TAH application fill the form at [iota.macrocosmos.ai/train-at-home](http://iota.macrocosmos.ai/train-at-home). We are scaling the system and gradually rolling out to more users. Currently TAH only supports MacOS, with Linux support coming soon.&#x20;

If you already have access, you can double click a `.dmg` file to install the app.&#x20;

We are still working on receiving notarization from Apple, therefore after opening the installed app you will be prompted with the warning "Apple could not verify "IOTA Train at Home.app" is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.

To work around the warning follow the next steps:

1. Using Apple logo in the top left open **System Settings -> Privacy & Security**
2. Click on **"Open Anyway"** - the app should open correctly

Once the app is installed you should be able to see the main dashboard:

You’ll see metrics for your model, and in the center there will be a visualization of all the other participants in the training.
