# TAH User Guide

## What is TAH?

Training at Home (TAH) is an application that allows you to connect and partake in our decentralized AI training platform called [IOTA](../../subnets/subnet-9-iota/README.md).
The app is built for you to be able to contribute any hardware you have access to and get rewarded for your contributions.
We aim to solve one of the biggest challenges in open-source AI today: the lack of a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient pre-training platform.

## Installation

There's currently a [shortlist](iota.macrocosmos.ai/train-at-home) to use TAH as we will slowly be scaling the system and rolling the app out to more and more users.
We also currently only support MacOS, with Linux support coming soon.
If you already have access you should've received a `.dmg` file, you can double click it to install the app.
We are still working on getting notirisation from Apple so after opening the installed app you will be prompted with something like this: <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/TAH-install-dmg.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
