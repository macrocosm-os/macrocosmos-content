Keep the machine plugged in, use a cooling pad/stand, and close heavy GPU/CPU apps. You can pause anytime by toggling **Start training** off.

The app auto-updates on startup or prompts when an update is available. Staying current is essential to avoid errors or security issues.

We store your public coldkey to pay you, and may store location and hardware metadata to allocate runs and monitor performance. Some training artifacts are stored locally on your machine.
