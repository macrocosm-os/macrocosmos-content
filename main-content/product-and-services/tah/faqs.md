# FAQs

**How do I get access?**
Use the shortlist link in the user guide. TAH will open to everyone soon (no waitlist once open) and all regions are supported.

**What platforms are supported?**
macOS at launch, Linux following soon after. Windows is not on the roadmap yet.

**Do I need to connect a wallet?**
No. Connecting is optional. Paste your public coldkey to receive rewards; support for popular wallet managers is coming soon. See the [Rewards](./rewards.md) page for payout details.

**What hardware do I need?**
16 GB RAM minimum; M‑class chips recommended but not required. See [Hardware & OS Requirements](./hardware-requirements.md) for full specs.

**Why is Start training disabled?**
Ensure you’re whitelisted (or TAH is open), the status shows **Connected**, you’re on the latest app version, and you have a stable network.

**How can I improve performance/heat?**
Keep the machine plugged in, use a cooling pad/stand, and close heavy GPU/CPU apps. You can pause anytime by toggling **Start training** off.

**How important is my internet connection?**
Very. A fast, stable connection is imperative; flaky Wi‑Fi, captive portals, or VPN drops can pause or remove you from a run.

**How do updates work?**
The app auto-updates on startup or prompts when an update is available. Staying current is imperative to avoid errors.

**What data do you store?**
We store your public coldkey to pay you, and may store location and hardware metadata to allocate runs and monitor performance. Some training artifacts are stored locally on your machine.

**Where can I get help?**
Discord or email (see contacts in the user guide).
