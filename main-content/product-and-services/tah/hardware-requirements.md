# Hardware & OS Requirements

#### Supported Platforms

* macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel). M‑class chips are recommended for efficiency but not required.
* Linux support is planned; Windows is not yet supported.

#### Minimum Specs (participate)

* CPU/GPU: Any modern Apple Silicon or Intel Mac capable of sustaining training loads.
* Memory: **16 GB RAM minimum**.
* Disk: At least 10 GB free for binaries, caches, and logs; up to **30 GB** may be required depending on the current model size being trained.
* Network: Fast, stable internet connection is imperative; training will stall on intermittent links.
* Power/uptime: Keep the machine plugged in and awake to maintain contribution.

#### Recommended Specs (best performance)

* Apple Silicon **M‑class chips** (M1/M2/M3) for best performance-per-watt.
* 16–32 GB RAM to avoid swapping under load.
* Wired Ethernet or strong Wi‑Fi 6 for steady throughput.
* Use a cooling pad or elevated stand to reduce thermal throttling during long runs.

#### Network & Security

* Requires a reliable internet connection throughout the session; reconnects may drop your rewards.
* Run on a trusted network; avoid captive portals or VPNs that frequently re-authenticate.
