# Training at Home

## What is TAH?

TAH is a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient pre-training platform. It is built on top of IOTA, a data- and pipeline-parallel training algorithm designed to operate on a network of heterogeneous, unreliable devices in adversarial and trustless environments. For more information on IOTA, please see the [IOTA documentation](../../subnets/subnet-9-iota/).
