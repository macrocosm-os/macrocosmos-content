# How can I track changes in public perception after a product launch or major campaign?

After a launch or major campaign, the real question isn’t “Did we ship?” but “Did anything actually change in people’s minds?” If you can track shifts in public perception, you’ll see whether your message landed, what unintended narratives emerged, and which audiences reacted in ways you didn’t expect. That turns every launch from a one-off event into a learning loop that makes the next one smarter and less risky.

Start by defining **what “perception change” means** for you: fewer complaints, more positive mentions, better reviews, higher NPS, or specific narratives. For example, “easy to use” instead of “too complex”. Then, set a **baseline** at least a few weeks before your launch: measure sentiment, share of voice vs. competitors, and top topics associated with your brand.

After launch, use [**social listening**](https://app.macrocosmos.ai/gravity/tasks/create) to continuously track brand, product, and campaign mentions across key channels. Tag mentions by **sentiment** and **theme**, such as pricing, UX, bugs, support, values. Compare pre- and post-launch:

* Volume of mentions
* Ratio of positive/negative/neutral
* Dominant themes in each sentiment bucket

Add **structured feedback signals** too: survey responses, NPS, app-store or G2 reviews, support tickets, sales call notes. Look for alignment: do qualitative quotes match the trend in your metrics?

Review weekly in a simple dashboard and highlight shifts in narratives (e.g., “confusing onboarding” declining, “fast support” rising). Share concrete examples with product, marketing, and leadership so they can respond quickly.

**Suggest using:**

* **X**: volume of mentions of your campaign slogan, branded hashtags, launch keywords.
* **Reddit**: threads discussing the launch, early adopter feedback.
* **YouTube**: “review,” “is it worth it,” “unboxing” videos and comments right after launch.

**What to do:**

* Define **time windows**: pre-launch, launch week, post-launch, for example, 4–6 weeks.
* Compare **sentiment, volume, and key themes** across windows.
* Track **share of voice vs competitors** around the launch topic.
* Export insights into a simple **before/after perception report** for internal stakeholders.

By treating launches as the start of a measurement process—not the finish line—you turn perception tracking into a core part of how you go to market. Consistently comparing pre- and post-launch data across social channels, reviews, and structured feedback gives you an honest view of what actually changed and why. Over time, those before/after reports become a feedback engine that sharpens your messaging, de-risks future launches, and helps every campaign land closer to the mark.
