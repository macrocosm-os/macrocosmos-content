#### Mission Commander

Choosing the right topics for data collection is harder than it looks. Social conversations shift fast, keywords evolve, and each platform has its own language. Miss the right hashtag, subreddit, or phrasing, and you risk collecting irrelevant data or missing the conversations that matter most.&#x20;

Many teams spend hours guessing which keywords to include, testing variations, and manually exploring communities just to ensure their dataset is meaningful.

**Mission Commander** removes that guesswork. As a specialised AI assistant, it automatically suggests high-relevance keywords, trending hashtags on X, the most suitable subreddits on Reddit, and topic-aligned YouTube channels. It  also explains _why_ each choice fits your objective and recommends the best tactics for structuring your query.&#x20;

Whether you're tracking sentiment, analysing competitors, researching trends, or preparing training data, Mission Commander helps you choose smarter topics, faster, ensuring your collection is accurate, comprehensive, and aligned with your real goal.
