# Bittensor

The Bittensor ecosystem is a competitive landscape, and fully understanding how entities interact within the network is a knowledge base that comes with time. However, there are some resources to prime yourself prior to developing subnets and, ultimately, incentive mechanisms. The [Bittensor Whitepaper](https://bittensor.com/whitepaper) is an excellent place to obtain a solid technical basis of how Bittensor works.

From the Bittensor Whitepaper:

> "The solution \[to creating a framework for machine intelligence] is a network of computers that share representations continuously and asynchronously, peer-to-peer (P2P) across the internet. The constructed market uses a digital ledger to record ranks and incentivize peers in a decentralized manner."

To learn more about the Bittensor ecosystem you should follow the [Bittensor documentation](https://docs.bittensor.com/).
