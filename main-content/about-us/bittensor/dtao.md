# DTAO

The introduction of dTAO is an important moment for Bittensor. For the first time, TAO holders, rather than validators, will be responsible for determining TAO emissions on the nework. In the process, they will also be exposed to a new system of risk and reward in holding ‘_subnet tokens_’.
