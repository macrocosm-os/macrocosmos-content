# Validator

Validators download the models from ðŸ¤— Hugging Face for each miner based on the Bittensor chain metadata and continuously evaluate them against, setting weights based on the performance of each model against the competition dataset. They also log results to [wandb](https://wandb.ai/rusticluftig/pretraining).

You can view the entire validation system by reading the code in `neurons/validator.py`. Pseudocode for the validation system is as follows:

```python
    weights = zeros(256)
    while True:
        # Choose the next competition in the schedule to evaluate.
        competition = constants.COMPETITION_SCHEDULE[
            self.global_step % len(constants.COMPETITION_SCHEDULE)
        ]

        # Fetch random sample of batches to evaluate models on
        batches = get_batches_for_competition(competition.id)
        
        # Fetch and or update models.
        models = get_and_update_models_from_miners_for_competition(competition.id)

        # Compute losses for each batch and each model
        model_losses = {}
        for model in models:
            for batch in batches:
                loss = get_loss_for_model_on_batch( model, batch )
                model_losses[ model ].append( loss )

        # Compute wins for models.
        model_wins = {}
        for model_a in models:
            for model_b in models:
                for i in len( batches )
                    # Determine if better model loss with relative block number boosting.
                    if iswin( model_losses[ model_a ][ i ], model_losses[ model_b ][ i ], block_a, block_b ):
                        model_wins[ model_a ] += 1
                            
        # End epoch.
        # Weights are computed based on the ratio of wins a model attains during the epoch.
        for model_i in models:
            competition_weights[ model_i ] += model_wins[ model_i ] / sum( model_wins.values() )
        
        # Track weights per competition.
        competition_tracker.record_competition_weights(
            competition.id, competition_weights
        )

        # Set weights on the chain based on relative weights for each competition.
        subnet_weights = competition_tracker.get_subnet_weights()
        set_weights( subnet_weights )
```

The behaviour of `iswin( loss_a, loss_b, block_a, block_b, epsilon_func, curr_block)` function intentionally skews the win function to reward models which have been hosted earlier such that newer models are only better than others iff their loss is `epsilon` percent lower accoring to the following function. `epsilon` is calculated based on a per-competition specified function based on the distance from the earlier model block to the current block.

```python
def iswin(loss_a, loss_b, block_a, block_b, epsilon_func, curr_block):
    loss_a = (1 - epsilon_func(curr_block, block_a)) * loss_a if block_a < block_b else loss_a
    loss_b = (1 - epsilon_func(curr_block, block_b)) * loss_b if block_b < block_a else loss_b
    return loss_a < loss_b
```

It is important to note that this affects the game theoretics of the incentive landscape since miners should only update their model (thus updating their timestamp to a newer date) if they have achieved an `epsilon` better loss on average on the competition dataset than their previous model. This undermines the obvious optimal strategy for miners to copy the publicly available models from other miners. They **can** and should copy other miners, but they will always obtain fewer wins compared to them until they also decrease their loss by `epsilon`.

# System Requirements

Validators will need enough disk space to store the model of every miner in the subnet. Each model (As of Jul 15th, 2024) is limited to 15 GB and 7B parameters, and the validator has cleanup logic to remove old models. It is recommended to have at least 3 TB of disk space.

Validators will need enough processing power to evaluate their model. As of Jul 15th, 2024 it is required to have a GPU with atleast 48 GB of VRAM and at least 38 TFLOPs for half precision (bfloat 16) operations.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

1. Get a Wandb Account:
Miners and validators use Wandb to download data from [subnet 1](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/prompting). Wandb accounts can be obtained at <https://wandb.ai/> and the user access token can be found at <https://wandb.ai/authorize> once logged in.

By default this will also be used to host validator logs for this subnet [here](https://wandb.ai/rusticluftig/pretraining).

2. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/macrocosm-os/finetuning.git
```

3. Setup your python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [Conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands).

4. Install the requirements. From your virtual environment, run

```shell
cd finetuning
python -m pip install -e .
```

Note: We require a python version of at least 3.9.

5. Make sure you've [created a Wallet](https://docs.bittensor.com/getting-started/wallets) and [registered a hotkey](https://docs.bittensor.com/subnets/register-and-participate).

6. (Optional) Run a Subtensor instance:

Your node will run better if you are connecting to a local Bittensor chain entrypoint node rather than using Opentensor's.
We recommend running a local node as follows and passing the ```--subtensor.network local``` flag to your running miners/validators.
To install and run a local subtensor node follow the commands below with Docker and Docker-Compose previously installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor.git
cd subtensor
docker compose up --detach
```

# Running the Validator

Before running `validator.py`, we recommend that you set `ulimit -n 64000` in your terminal to reduce the chance of subprocess errors.

## Env File

The Validator requires a .env file with your Wandb access token in order to download evaluation data from [subnet 1](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/prompting) and upload logs to this subnets wandb.

Create a `.env` file in the `finetuning` directory and add the following to it:

```shell
WANDB_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_WANDB_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## With auto-updates

We highly recommend running the validator with auto-updates. This will help ensure your validator is always running the latest release, helping to maintain a high vtrust.

Prerequisites:

1. To run with auto-update, you will need to have [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) installed.
2. Make sure your virtual environment is activated. This is important because the auto-updater will automatically update the package dependencies with pip.
3. Make sure you're using the main branch: `git checkout main`.

From the finetuning folder:

```shell
pm2 start --name finetune-vali-updater --interpreter python scripts/start_validator.py -- --pm2_name finetune-vali --wallet.name coldkey --wallet.hotkey hotkey [other vali flags]
```

This will start a process called `finetune-vali-updater`. This process periodically checks for a new git commit on the current branch. When one is found, it performs a `pip install` for the latest packages, and restarts the validator process (who's name is given by the `--pm2_name` flag)

## Without auto-updates

If you'd prefer to manage your own validator updates...

From the `finetuning` folder:

```shell
pm2 start python -- ./neurons/validator.py --wallet.name coldkey --wallet.hotkey hotkey
```

# Configuration

## Flags

The Validator offers some flags to customize properties, such as the device to evaluate on and the number of models to evaluate each step.

You can view the full set of flags by running

```shell
python ./neurons/validator.py -h
```

## Test Running Validation

You can also test a validator by running it in offline mode. In offline mode, it won't set weights, nor upload data to wandb.

```shell
python neurons/validator.py 
    --wallet.name YOUR_WALLET_NAME
    --wallet.hotkey YOUR_WALLET_HOTKEY 
    --wandb.off
    --offline
```
