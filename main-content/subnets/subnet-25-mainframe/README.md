# Subnet 25 - Mainframe

Mainframe is a decentralised science subnet on Bittensor. It provides computing power and community talent to solve multiple scientific problems.

The subnet started from the Protein Folding molecular dynamic simulation.

Protein folding is one of the most computationally complex and technically challenging problems in academia. It’s also the gateway to novel drug discovery and promising medical breakthroughs. Protein engineering is already a $2.6bn market, and set to grow significantly. It’s also very computationally intensive. It can take days or weeks to fully simulate complex structures, which restricts research to large and well-funded institutions.&#x20;

This combination of computational complexity and potential payoff has attracted the world’s best AI researchers and entrepreneurs. However, although programs like AlphaFold3 offer state-of-the-art protein folding, their centralised model entails high costs of compute and concomitant costs for researchers, who are often limited to a fixed number of queries per day.&#x20;

Subnet 25 was Bittensor’s first venture into academic use cases, providing a competitive, distributed marketplace for the modeling of protein folding using molecular dynamics (MD), at a more cost-effective rate than centralised rivals. In doing so, subnet 25 demonstrates the network’s efficacy and flexibility, proving that we can tackle computationally complex problems with significant market value. Subnet 25 demonstrated that Bittensor  effectiveness in solving scientifically significant challenges like protein-folding, and that it can win attention, confidence, and greater investment. &#x20;

Using industry standard OpenMM software, subnet 25 incentivises miners to simulate the molecular dynamics of proteins whose configurations coincide with the lowest energy (analogous to loss). This aligns with the desired outcome of biologically stable structures, while also being pseudo-deterministic and transparent. The molecular dynamics simulation takes an initial 3D protein structure, puts it in a cell-like environment, and models its systematic evolution in time. When run successfully, the simulation is able to accurately predict the final (or native) 3D structure. This allows researchers to understand the protein’s biological function.

Since launching in June 2024, subnet 25 has already completed over 400,000 protein-folding jobs using GROMACS and [150,000 jobs on OpenMM](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn25/dashboard).&#x20;

Our ambition is to produce a decentralized optimized supercomputer, optimizing the study of proteins and other molecules so that it is more efficient and accessible and open significantly bigger market of scientific research and drug discovery.

We envision this subnet to empower researchers to conduct world-class research in the drug discovery area utilising deep-learning combined with molecular dynamics tools.

By combining deep-learning-based protein structure prediction with molecular dynamics to explore conformational states, researchers can:

* Determine druggability: Identify pockets suitable for small-molecule binding.
* Optimize compounds: Use MD-guided filters to refine and rank ligands.
* Reduce R\&D costs: Mitigate the need for trial-and-error screening.

For biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, MD simulations represent a solid strategy for prioritizing projects and focusing experimental resources where they are most likely to succeed.

By demonstrating the advantages of distributed compute for solving complex challenges, subnet 25 is pioneering cutting-edge science on the blockchain - and exemplifying how Macrocosmos and Bittensor can be deployed to stimulate academically rigorous and commercially significant research.
