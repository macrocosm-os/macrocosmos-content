# Subnet 25 - Mainframe

Mainframe is a decentralised science subnet on Bittensor. It provides computing power and community talent to solve scientific problems.

The subnet started from by looking into protein folding molecular dynamic simulations.

Protein folding is one of the most computationally complex problems in academia. It’s also the gateway to novel drug discovery and promising medical breakthroughs. Protein engineering is already a $2.6bn market, and set to grow significantly. It’s also technically challenging. It can take days or weeks to fully simulate complex structures, making it typically only accessible to the large corporations.

This combination of computational complexity and cost has attracted the world’s best AI researchers and entrepreneurs. However, while programs like AlphaFold offer state-of-the-art protein folding, their centralised model entails high costs for computing and for researchers, who are often limited to a fixed number of queries per day.&#x20;

Subnet 25 was Bittensor’s first venture into academic use cases, providing a competitive, distributed marketplace for protein folding using molecular dynamics (MD), at a more cost-effective rate than centralised rivals. In doing so, subnet 25 demonstrates the network’s efficacy and flexibility, proving that we can tackle computationally rich problems with significant market value.

Using, [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/), an industry standard for protein folding, subnet 25 incentivises miners to simulate the molecular dynamics of proteins whose configurations coincide with the lowest energy (analogous to loss). This aligns with the desired outcome of biologically stable structures, while also being pseudo-deterministic and transparent. The molecular dynamics simulation takes an initial 3D protein structure, puts it in a cell-like environment, and models its systematic evolution in time. When it's run successfully, the simulation can accurately predict the final (or native) 3D structure. This allows researchers to understand the protein’s biological function.

Since launching in June 2024, subnet 25 has already completed over 400,000 protein-folding jobs using GROMACS and [150,000 jobs on OpenMM](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn25/dashboard).&#x20;

Our ambition is to produce a decentralized and specialized supercomputer, optimizing the study of proteins and other molecules making it more efficient and accessible, whilst opening us to the scientific research and drug discovery market.

This subnet is designed to empower researchers to conduct world-class drug discovery research utilising deep-learning and molecular dynamics. This allows researchers to:

* Determine _druggability_: Identify pockets suitable for small-molecule binding.
* Optimize compounds: Use MD-guided filters to refine and rank ligands.
* Reduce R\&D costs: Mitigate the need for trial-and-error screening.

For biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, MD simulations represent a solid strategy for prioritizing projects and focusing experimental resources where they are most likely to succeed.

Subnet 25 is pioneering cutting-edge science on the blockchain - and exemplifying how Macrocosmos and Bittensor can be deployed to stimulate academically rigorous and commercially significant research.
