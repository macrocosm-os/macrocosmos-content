# Subnet 13 Data Universe

## What is SN13 — Data Universe

**Subnet 13** is Bittensor’s decentralized data layer, focused on the **collection, and distribution of fresh, desirable data**.

Its incentive mechanism rewards miners for gathering content that is desirable, based on the following:

* Source of the data
* Specific categories of data within that source
* The age of the data
* &#x20;Data uniqueness&#x20;

Currently, miners are incentivized to scrap data from platforms like **Reddit** and **X (Twitter).** Keeping the focus on rapidly shifting trends , because we all know in today’s world, stale data just doesn’t cut it.

API Documentation is available at [Macrocosmos API](../../).

## Why It Matters

In fast-moving markets, **up-to-date data** is critical. Data provided by subnet 13's product [Data Universe](https://datauniverse.macrocosmos.ai/) allows businesses to:

* Track brand sentiment and market shifts in real time
* Make data-driven decisions based on the latest insights
* Refine strategy and stay competitive with fresh intelligence

As machine learning becomes more focused on the output, the **quality of training data** will become a key differentiator. SN13 aims to make **data one of Bittensor’s most valuable commodities.**

## Architecture

Subnet 13's decentralized design allows data to be distributed across miners and queried by validators, showcasing Bittensor's scalability. Macrocosmos is expanding data sources, developing a queryable API ([endpoints.md](../../developers/api-documentation/sn13-data-universe/endpoints.md "mention")), and is currently one of the largest data providers with access to over 55 billion scraped posts and comments. By providing the raw material for pre-training and inference, subnet 13 is poised to supercharge the next stage of AI model development within the Bittensor ecosystem.

## Gravity Client - Macrocosmos API

Using the `GravityClient` in the **Macrocosmos API**, you can easily launch scraping tasks and get structured datasets built by miners.

API Documentation is available at [Macrocosmos API](../../).

You'll also need an API key. Visit [Data Universe](https://app.macrocosmos.ai/account) to get started.
