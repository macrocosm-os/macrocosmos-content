# Subnet 13 - Data Universe

## What is SN13 — Data Universe

**Subnet 13** is Bittensor’s decentralized data layer , focused on the **collection, and distribution of fresh, desirable data**.

Its incentive mechanism rewards miners for gathering content that is desirable, based on the following:

* Source of the data
* Specific categories of data within that source
* The age of the data
* &#x20;Data uniqueness&#x20;

Currently, miners are incentivized to scrap data from platforms like **Reddit** and **X (Twitter) .** Keeping the focus on rapidly shifting trends , because we all know in today’s world, stale data just doesn’t cut it.

## Why It Matters

In fast-moving markets, **up-to-date data** is critical. Data provided by subnet 13's product, [Gravity, ](../../constellation/gravity.md)allows businesses to:

* Track brand sentiment and market shifts in real time
* Make data-driven decisions based on the latest insights
* Refine strategy and stay competitive with fresh intelligence

As machine learning becomes more commoditized, the **quality of training data** will become a key differentiator. SN13 aims to make **data one of Bittensor’s most valuable commodities.**

Alongside Gravity is [Nebula](https://app.gitbook.com/o/eu9Z3qt7ycTIHIJGObFB/s/JDlWdmSC3GnzBPSkAiBM/), our second product launched on SN13. Its purpose is to perform analytics on data.



## Architecture

Subnet 13's decentralized design allows data to be distributed across miners and queried by validators, showcasing Bittensor's scalability. Macrocosmos is expanding data sources, developing a queryable API ([endpoints.md](../../api-documentation/sn13-gravity/endpoints.md "mention")), and is currently the largest open source data provider on HuggingFace with over 17 billion scraped posts and comments (as of January 2025). By providing the raw material for pre-training and inference, subnet 13 is poised to supercharge the next stage of AI model development within the Bittensor ecosystem.



Subnet 13's [interactive dashboard](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn13/dashboard) not only provides up-to-date metrics on the total scraped posts, total amount of datasets or scraping speed, but also statistics on the datasets content with the amount of posts scraped per the most popular topics. The dashboard interface allows filtering based on the content age and daily scraping metrics, whilst offering a different table-formated UX.
