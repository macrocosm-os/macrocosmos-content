# Subnet 13 - Data Universe

Subnet 13, Data Universe, is focused on the collection and distribution of data. Its incentive mechanism establishes a framework for the collection of fresh, unique and desirable data. “Desirable” is defined as being configurable along several dimensions:&#x20;

* Source of the data
* Specific categories of data within that source
* The age of the data
* &#x20;Data uniqueness&#x20;

Currently, miners are incentivised to collect fresh content from Reddit and X.&#x20;

In a world where consumer preferences shift overnight, businesses battle to stay relevant— outdated, incomplete data is no longer an option. Therefore, fresh data is more important than ever before.

Data provided by subnet 13's product, [Gravity, ](../../constellation/gravity.md)allows businesses to:

* Track brand performance and identify emerging market shifts in real time,
* Make data-driven decisions based on the latest information,
* Leverage fresh insights to refine strategies, outpace competitors, and drive growth.

With subnet 13, we’re building the world's most directable mechanism for data acquisition - magnetically drawing in masses of data and transmitting it in an accessible, directable, and targetable way to the whole Bittensor community.&#x20;

Dataset selection shapes the quality of models. As the marketplace for machine learning models grows more competitive, datasets will increasingly become a key differentiating factor. Our goal is to make data one of Bittensor's strongest commodities.

Alongside Gravity is [Nebula](https://app.gitbook.com/o/eu9Z3qt7ycTIHIJGObFB/s/JDlWdmSC3GnzBPSkAiBM/), our second product launched on SN13. Its purpose is to perform analytics on data.

Subnet 13's decentralized design allows data to be distributed across miners and queried by validators, showcasing Bittensor's scalability. Macrocosmos is expanding data sources, developing a querable API, and is currently the largest open source data provider on HuggingFace with over 17 billion scraped posts and comments (as of January 2025). By providing the raw material for pretraining and inference, subnet 13 is poised to supercharge the next stage of AI model development within the Bittensor ecosystem.

Subnet 13's [interactive dashboard](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn13/dashboard) not only provides up-to-date metrics on the total scraped rows, total amount of datasets or scraping speed, but also statistics on the datasets content with the amount of rows scraped per the most popular topics. The dashboard interface allows filtering based on the content age and daily scraping metrics, whilst offering a different table-formated UX.
