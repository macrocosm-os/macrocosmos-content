# Subnet 13 - Data Universe

Subnet 13 Data Universe incentivises collection and distribution of data. The incentive mechanism establishes a framework for collection of fresh, unique and desirable data. The definition of “desirable” is configurable along several dimensions: source of the data, specific categories of data within that source, the age of the data, and data uniqueness. Today, miners are incentivised to collect fresh content from Reddit and X.&#x20;

In a world where consumer preferences shift overnight, businesses battle to stay relevant— outdated, incomplete data is no longer an option.

Data provided by subnet 13 product [Gravity ](../../constellation/gravity.md)allows businesses to:

* Track brand performance and identify emerging market shifts in real time,
* Make data-driven decisions based on the latest data,
* Leverage fresh insights to refine strategies, outpace competitors, and drive growth.

With subnet 13, we’re building the world's most directable mechanism for data acquisition - magnetically drawing in masses of data and transmitting it in an accessible, directable, and targetable way to the whole Bittensor community. Gravity is a product enabling directable and scalable data scraping.

Dataset selection shapes the quality of models. As the marketplace for machine learning models grows more competitive, datasets will increasingly become a key differentiating factor. Our goal is to make data the one of Bittensor's strongest commodities, and subnet 13 to become a huge power for it.

The other product - [Nebula](https://app.gitbook.com/o/eu9Z3qt7ycTIHIJGObFB/s/JDlWdmSC3GnzBPSkAiBM/), par of the Constellation platform - allows to perform initial analysis of data.

Subnet 13 decentralized design allows data to be distributed across Miners and queried by Validators, showcasing Bittensor's scalability. Macrocosmos is expanding data sources, developing a queryable API (section 4b), and is currently the largest open source data provider on HuggingFace with over 17 billion scraped posts and comments as of January 2025. By providing the raw material for pretraining and inference, subnet 13 is poised to supercharge the next stage of AI model development within the Bittensor ecosystem.

Subnet 13 [interactive dashboard](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn13/dashboard) not only provides up to date metrics on the total scraped rows, total amount of datasets or scraping speed, but also statistics on the datasets content with the amount of rows scraped per the most popular topics. The dashboard interface allows filtering based on the content age, daily scraping metrics and different UX using the table format.
