# Subnet 9 - IOTA

&#x20;In August 2024, Bittensor’s Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed network of incentivized,\
permissionless actors could each pretrain large language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million\
to 14 billion parameters, while surpassing established baselines. While that work validated\
blockchain-based decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: every miner had to\
fit an entire model locally, and “winner-takes-all” rewards encouraged model hoarding.&#x20;

Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an architecture that\
addresses these limitations by transforming SN9’s previously isolated competitors into a single\
cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily while still rewarding each contributor fairly. IOTA is a\
data- and pipeline-parallel training algorithm designed to operate on a network of heterogeneous,\
unreliable devices in adversarial and trustless environments. The result is a permissionless system\
that is capable of pretraining frontier-scale models without per-node GPU bloat, and tolerates\
unreliable devices and (3) aligns participants through transparent token economics.

Before participating in subnet 9, you should familiarise yourself with the [Bittensor documentation](https://docs.bittensor.com/), describing the ecosystem and relationships between network participants.

For more details on how to contribute you can have a looks at [**mining instructions**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/eu9Z3qt7ycTIHIJGObFB/s/JDlWdmSC3GnzBPSkAiBM/~/changes/165/subnets/subnet-9-pre-training/subnet-9-iota-mining-setup-guide), and [**validating** **instructions**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/eu9Z3qt7ycTIHIJGObFB/s/JDlWdmSC3GnzBPSkAiBM/~/changes/165/subnets/subnet-9-pre-training/subnet-9-validating).
