# Current Competitions

### Matrix Compression (Lossless)

The first competition, explores how small neural activations—both forward and backward—can be compressed while still retaining all their original information. Reducing activation size enables faster data transfer across the internet, a crucial step toward making distributed training more efficient, as it’s often constrained by network bandwidth. The top-performing algorithms from this competition will be integrated to enhance training on **IOTA**. A follow-up **lossy** compression competition is planned for the future.
