# Subnet 1 Mining Setup Guide

## Miner Documentation

### Overview

The Apex Miner is a minimalistic implementation designed for educational purposes within the Bittensor network. It provides both **generator** and **discriminator** functionality for the Apex subnet.

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: This is a dummy miner implementation. Do not run it on mainnet as it won't produce any yields and the registration fee will be lost.

### Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **HTTP Server**: Uses aiohttp to serve requests on `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
2. **Bittensor Integration**: Connects to Bittensor network using subtensor and wallet
3. **Dual Functionality**: Acts as both generator and discriminator

#### Network Configuration

* **Testnet**: NetUID 61
* **Mainnet**: NetUID 1 (not recommended for this dummy implementation)

### Functionality

#### Generator Mode

When `step` parameter equals `"generator"`:

* Receives a query in the request body
* Returns a generation response
* The miner should try to match the validator's reference as close as possible, within a much shorter time.

```python
# Current dummy implementation
response = "This is a dummy generation from the base miner"
```

#### Discriminator Mode

When `step` parameter is not `"generator"`:

* Receives query and generation in request body
* Should classify the response (Miner class: 1, Validator class: 0)

```python
# Current dummy implementation
response = random.choice(["0", "1"])
```

### Setup and Usage

#### Prerequisites

* Python environment with required dependencies
* Bittensor wallet (coldkey and hotkey)
  * To register a neuron, see [the documentation](https://docs.learnbittensor.org/miners/#miner-registration).
* Network access for IP detection and subnet communication

#### Command Line Arguments

```bash
python miner.py [OPTIONS]
```

| Argument    | Default  | Description                      |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--network` | "test"   | Network type: "test" or "finney" |
| `--coldkey` | Required | Coldkey name for wallet          |
| `--hotkey`  | Required | Hotkey name for wallet           |
| `--port`    | 8080     | Port to serve the miner on       |

#### Example Usage

```bash
# Run on testnet
python miner.py --network test --coldkey my_coldkey --hotkey my_hotkey --port 8080

# Run on finney (not recommended for dummy miner)
python miner.py --network finney --coldkey my_coldkey --hotkey my_hotkey --port 8080
```

### Request Format

The miner accepts POST requests to `/v1/chat/completions` with JSON body:

#### Generator Request

```json
{
  "step": "generator",
  "query": "Your input query here"
}
```

#### Discriminator Request

```json
{
  "step": "discriminator",
  "query": "Input query",
  "generation": "Response to classify"
}
```

### Miner Ecosystem

#### Miner Sampling

The validator system includes a `MinerSampler` class that:

* Samples miners from the network metagraph
* Supports random and sequential sampling modes
* Queries multiple miners simultaneously
* Tracks miner information (hotkey, UID, address)

#### Scoring System

The `MinerScorer` evaluates miner performance:

* Uses a 22-hour scoring window
* Sets weights based on performance
* Updates scores periodically (every 22 hours by default)
* Connects to results database for historical data

### For Competition:

#### Critical Implementation Needed

1. **Generator Function**: Replace dummy response with actual text generation
   * Implement proper language model or API integration
   * Handle different types of queries appropriately
2. **Discriminator Function**: Implement actual classification logic
   * Develop criteria for miner vs validator classification
   * Use query and generation context for accurate scoring

### Security Considerations

* **Mainnet Warning**: This implementation is not production-ready
* **Registration Fees**: Running on mainnet will result in lost registration fees
* **IP Exposure**: Miner IP is publicly registered on the network
* **Wallet Security**: Protect coldkey and hotkey credentials

### Integration Points

#### Validator Integration

* Validators query miners using the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
* Results are used for miner scoring and weight setting
* Performance data is logged to database

#### Network Integration

* Automatic IP detection using AWS checkip service
* Subnet registration via Bittensor serve\_extrinsic
* Protocol version 4 compliance

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**: Change the `--port` parameter
2. **Wallet Not Found**: Verify coldkey and hotkey names
3. **Network Connection**: Check internet connectivity and firewall settings
4. **Subnet Registration**: Ensure sufficient balance for registration fees
