# Subnet 1: How to use APEX

Before working with subnet 1, you should familiarize yourself with the [Bittensor documentation](https://docs.bittensor.com/), describing the ecosystem and relationships between network participants.

***

## There are several ways to get started with APEX

### Mine and Validate on Apex

Help power the subnet by contributing compute and serving LLM responses. Start here:

* [OpenAI Bittensor Miner Guide](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/apex/blob/main/docs/epistula_miner.md) – for spinning up a general-purpose miner.
* [Stream Miner Walkthrough](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/apex/blob/main/docs/stream_miner_template.md) – for low-latency, streaming-style mining.
* For validation, follow [SN1's Validation](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/prompting/blob/main/docs/SN1_validation.md) guide and [Validator](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/prompting/blob/main/docs/validator.md) instructions.
* SN1 base miner setup guide - [subnet-1-base-miner-setup.md](subnet-1-base-miner-setup.md "mention")

### Prompt via the API (LLM-as-a-Service)

* [api-documentation](../../developers/api-documentation/ "mention")– learn how to send prompts, and retrieve responses&#x20;

### Build with the Macrocosmos SDK

* Integrate Apex directly into your Python applications using the SDK - [apex.md](../../developers/macrocosmos-sdk/apex.md "mention")
