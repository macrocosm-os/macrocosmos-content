## There are several ways to get started with APEX

### Mine and Validate on Apex

Help power the subnet by contributing compute and serving LLM responses. Start here:

* To get started with mining, read [here](subnet-1-base-miner-setup.md)
* For getting started with validation, please read the README.md located in the repo

### Prompt via the API (LLM-as-a-Service)

* [api-documentation](../../developers/api-documentation/ "mention")â€“ learn how to send prompts, and retrieve responses&#x20;

### Build with the Macrocosmos SDK

* Integrate Apex directly into your Python applications using the SDK - [apex.md](../../developers/macrocosmos-sdk/apex.md "mention")
