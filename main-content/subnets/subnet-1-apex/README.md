# Subnet 1 - Apex

Subnet 1’s objective is the creation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source intelligence, through the use of deentralized competitions. Bittensor requires persistent research and innovation to compete with leading proprietary models for it to continue being a viable solution to closed-soruce and centralized alternatives.&#x20;

Today’s leading research suggests that specialisation is the key mechanism in enabling open-source models to compete with their leading proprietary counterparts. Therefore, the purpose of subnet 1 today is as follows:

* Produce agentic workflows in conjunction with LLMs that surpass the capabilities of proprietary models at specific tasks.
* Develop enhanced inference techniques such as ensembling and o1-style reasoning.
* Demonstrate that decentralised systems are a viable path towards creating truly open SOTA AI models.
* Be the main entry-point for new users & become Bittensor's flagship subnetwork.
* Power an intelligent interface to interact with other digital commodities.

Subnet 1 has a long legacy within Bittensor. Historically, it's championed research in LLM-based incentive design, and was rebuilt in January 2024 in order to utilize current methodologies in the fast-paced LLM research community.&#x20;

Agentic workflows have emerged as a viable way to enhance the performance of LLMs by equipping them with task-specific tools such as the ability to use APIs, run code, and search the web. In doing so, it's improved the factual accuracy of responses, reduced hallucinations and enabled deeper and more reasoned generations.&#x20;

Alongside this, we integrate enhanced inference techniques such as response ensembling, multi-step reasoning, and chain-of-thought. This allows extremely high fidelity answers, as well as advanced intelligence that bridges between Macrocosmos products. Our subnet strikes a balance between innovation and productisation: we view both as necessary for success.

Subnet 1 enhances the Bittensor environment by:

* Creating an [arena for miners ](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn1/dashboard)to relentlessly innovate when creating agents which can compete with proprietary models.
* Producing highly specialised, targeted intelligence as a digital commodity for users.
* Providing chat interfaces, APIs, and other mechanisms for users and businesses to interact with the intelligent hivemind. At present, subnet 1 powers multiple different user-facing products, one of which being [Apex](../../constellation/apex.md), part of our Constellation platform.
* Subnet 1 additionally allows [Validators to spin up their own api endpoints with 1 line,](https://github.com/macrocosm-os/prompting/blob/main/validator_api/API_docs.md) using OpenAI standard endpoints for seamless streaming to front-ends and plug-ins.
* Expanding the incentive landscape and framework of Bittensor, building on its legacy as the flagship subnet of the protocol, and continuing to push the boundaries of mechanism design.
* Providing a wide range of opportunities to interlock with other subnets such as:
  * subnets 37, Finetuning, and subnet 9, Pre-training, through synthetic data generation.
  * subnet 13, Data Universe, through data annotation and sentiment analysis.
  * subnet 19, Inference, offloading tasks to an inference-specific subnet.

[Subnet 1's Dashboard](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn1/dashboard) provides a variety of metrics for the competition and the models performance quality.
