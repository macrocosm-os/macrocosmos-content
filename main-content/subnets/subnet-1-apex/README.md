# Subnet 1 Apex

## What is Subnet 1?

**Subnet 1** is Bittensor’s flagship subnet, focused on building **state-of-the-art open-source intelligence** through decentralized competitions and cutting-edge LLM research. Bittensor requires persistent research and innovation to compete with leading proprietary models for it to continue being a viable solution to closed-source and centralized alternatives.&#x20;

## Core Goals

* Produce agentic workflows with LLMs that surpass the capabilities of proprietary models at specific tasks.
* Develop advanced inference techniques like **response ensembling** and **chain-of-thought reasoning**.
* Prove that decentralized systems can produce **SOTA AI models**.
* Serve as **Bittensor’s main entry point** for new users.
* Power smart interfaces to interact with other subnets and digital tools.



## Why SN1 Matters

With a long-standing legacy in the ecosystem, SN1 has led the way in **LLM-based incentive design**. It was rebuilt in January 2024 to take full advantage of the latest breakthroughs in LLM research and infrastructure.

One of SN1’s biggest innovations is the development of **agentic workflows** — LLM-powered agents equipped with tools like API access, code execution, and web search. These workflows dramatically improve performance by reducing hallucinations, boosting accuracy, and enabling deeper, more reasoned outputs.

Subnet 1 enhances the Bittensor environment by:

* Creating an [arena for miners ](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn1/dashboard)to relentlessly build innovative agents designed to compete with proprietary models.
* Producing highly specialised, targeted intelligence as a digital commodity for users.
* Providing chat interfaces, APIs, and other mechanisms for users and businesses to interact with the intelligent hivemind. At present, subnet 1 powers multiple user-facing products, one of which being [Apex](../../constellation-user-guides/apex/), part of our Constellation platform.
* Subnet 1 additionally allows Validators to spin up their own api endpoints with 1 line, using OpenAI standard endpoints for seamless streaming to front-ends and plug-ins.
* Expanding Bittensor's incentive landscape and framework, building on its legacy as the protocol's flagship subnet, and continuing to push the boundaries of mechanism design.



## Interoperability

Subnet 1 works closely with other subnets to expand its capabilities:

* subnets 37, Finetuning, and subnet 9, Pre-Training, through synthetic data generation,
* subnet 13, Data Universe, through data annotation and sentiment analysis,
* subnet 19, Inference, offloading tasks to an inference-specific subnet.



## Apex Client - Macrocosmos SDK

**(SN1)** runs open-source language models like LLaMA and Mistral, and you can interact with it easily using the [macrocosmos-sdk](../../developers/macrocosmos-sdk/ "mention")\
With the `ApexClient`, you can send prompts, run chat completions, and perform live web searches — all decentralized and miner-powered.\


**You'll also need an API key. Visit** [api-documentation](../../developers/api-documentation/ "mention") to get started.



#### TLDR

Subnet 1 plays a key role in Bittensor’s mission to compete with closed-source models by focusing on **specialization, innovation, and usability**. It strikes a balance between **research** and real-world **productization**, advancing the application of decentralized AI. Check out  [Subnet 1's Dashboard](https://www.macrocosmos.ai/sn1/dashboard) for a variety of metrics for the competition and the model's performance quality.
