### Mining

<details>

<summary>Where do I start with mining the subnet 1?</summary>

Read the docs related to the [Apex subnet](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex) and [current competitions](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-current-competitions). Have a look at the [Subnet 1 Mining](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-base-miner-setup) for the setup guidance.&#x20;

<summary>How to test my miner locally?</summary>

You can use the sample tasks from manifest file to perform local testing. See instruction on [how to get sample tasks](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex/current-competitions#for-miners). To emulate the validator, have a look at the [Validating](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex/validating) instructions.

<summary>Where can I see my scores and other metrics?</summary>

Each competition has it's own dashboard demonstrating relevant metrics. You can find them on the Apex website at [apex.macrocosmos.ai/](https://apex.macrocosmos.ai/) in the competition section. Also [Apex CLI](https://docs.macrocosmos.ai/subnets/subnet-1-apex/subnet-1-base-miner-setup/apex-cli) provides a set of metrics for the competitions.
