### **Create a New Task**

Let’s say you’re building an app that tracks **real-time crypto market sentiment**. You want to collect social media posts from Reddit and X that mention major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NEAR, so you can analyze public perception and spot early trends.



* Start by giving your task a name, like:\
  &#xNAN;**"ETH Compass"**
* Specify the data source (e.g., Reddit, Twitter).​
* **Define Your Keywords** Tell Gravity what to look for:
  * For **X**, enter hashtags like:\
    `#Bitcoin`, `#ETH`, `#Solana`, `#DeFi`
  * For **Reddit**, specify relevant subreddits such as:\
    `r/CryptoCurrency`, `r/Bitcoin`, `r/Ethereum`, `r/NEAR`
  *
