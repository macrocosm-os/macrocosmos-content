# About Macrocosmos

At Macrocosmos, we believe **artificial intelligence is too important to be locked behind closed doors**. Our mission is to create a democratised AI ecosystem that benefits everyone.

By leveraging distributed networks, we aim to build the world's largest decentralised supercomputer, fostering an open, competitive marketplace for intelligence.

This is your opportunity to be part of a ground-breaking journey where you can innovate, solve complex problems, and contribute to a mission that aligns with the greater good.

Macrocosmos was formed in March 2024. Evolving out of the launch of "Revolution" on Bittensor, which led to the subnet epoch in the network, in which individual teams could build their own intelligence profile. The Macrocosmos team was part of the original team that built Bittensor, and our code sits at the heart of every subnet on the network.

We run five subnets:

* [Subnet 1 Apex](subnets/subnet-1-apex/)
* [Subnet 9 IOTA](subnets/subnet-9-iota/)
* [Subnet 13 Data-Universe](subnets/subnet-13-data-universe/)
* [Subnet 25 Mainframe](subnets/subnet-25-mainframe/)
* [Subnet 37 Finetuning](subnet-37-finetuning/)
