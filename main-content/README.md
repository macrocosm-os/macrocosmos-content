# Macrocosmos API

## Overview

Macrocosmos API makes it easy to bring fresh, structured social data into your product, pipeline, or analysis. Through [Data Universe](https://app.macrocosmos.ai/gravity/marketplace) platform you can access high-signal content from X (Twitter) and Reddit, and turn it into action right away powering market intelligence, brand monitoring, trend tracking, lead research, and AI training with clean outputs that fit directly into your workflow.

Data Universe is built for teams that need both speed and scale:&#x20;

* use On-Demand API requests for real-time queries,&#x20;
* or run dataset jobs to collect large batches over time, delivered in clean, consistent formats with rich metadata.&#x20;

Compared to traditional data providers, Data Universe is designed to be high-volume, low-friction, and cost-efficient, so you can go from a quick test to production workloads with a single API key.

Macrocosmos API provides extensive documentation and built-in support for authentication to ensure a smooth experience from prototyping to production.

## Why Build with Macrocosmos?

Whether you are a developer, data scientist, researcher, growth/marketing team, or agency, Macrocosmos API helps you turn live social platforms into reliable inputs for products, analytics, and automation.

Choose the workflow that matches your goal:

* On-demand queries for immediate lookups and quick experiments
* Dataset builds for high-volume collection and repeatable pipelines
* Streaming for continuous monitoring and real-time signals

Macrocosmos makes it accessible to:

* **Monitor**\
  Track keywords, brands, topics, creators, and communities in near real time, so you can spot spikes, sentiment shifts, competitor moves, and emerging narratives early.
*   **Research**

    Collect high-signal posts, threads, and conversations from social media to validate ideas, map audiences, measure demand, and uncover the “why” behind trends.
*   **Enrich**

    Turn raw social activity into structured fields you can attach to leads, accounts, companies, or segments powering better targeting, scoring, personalization, and reporting in your tools.
*   **Train LLMs**

    Build fresh, domain-specific datasets for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, so AI agents and LLMs perform better on real-world language, up-to-date topics, and niche communities.
