# Macrocosmos SDK

## Overview

Whether you're building cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) products, connecting to Bittensor subnets, or orchestrating large-scale data flows, the Macrocosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) simplifies access to the powerful tools and systems behind the Macrocosmos [Constellation Platform](https://app.macrocosmos.ai/).

Macrocosmos SDK provides developers with a robust API for integrating Macrocosmos’s advanced AI and data infrastructure into applications, services, and research pipelines. Its extensive documentation, built-in support for authentication ensure a smooth experience from prototyping to production.

## Why Build with Macrocosmos?

Macrocosmos makes it accessible to:

* Through intuitive APIs Macrocosmos SDK abstracts away the low-level details of building over the subnets.
* Developers can streamline and scale the data collection process — fetching millions of posts, hashtags, or profiles automatically.
* APIs let you continuously monitor live social activity on specific keywords, usernames, or topics.
