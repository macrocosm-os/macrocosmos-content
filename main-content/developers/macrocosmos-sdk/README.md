# Macrocosmos SDK

## Overview

This SDK enables developers integrate AI applications with [Constellation](https://app.macrocosmos.ai/mission-command) - a network of decentralized subnets running on Bittensor.&#x20;

### ðŸš€ Why Build with Macrocosmos?

Macrocosmos makes it easy to:

* **Interact with AI models on-chain**: Use the Apex (SN1) subnet to send prompts to open source LLMs running in a decentralized way.
* **Access real-time social data**: Query Reddit and Twitter/X through Gravity (SN13), powered by validator-coordinated scraping infrastructure.
* **Extend and monetize**: Interact with Constellation for real-time data feeds, and even propose new subnet features.
