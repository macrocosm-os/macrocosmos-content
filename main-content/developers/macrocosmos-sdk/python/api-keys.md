# API Keys

To get started with the Macrocosmos SDK, developers need to generate an API key by visiting [https://cloud.macrocosmos.ai/](https://cloud.macrocosmos.ai/). You'll be prompted to sign in with your email address.



Navigate to the right hand sand of your screen, where you will find `Personal API Keys` , select `new API key` , you can generate and manage your API keys from the dashboard.&#x20;
