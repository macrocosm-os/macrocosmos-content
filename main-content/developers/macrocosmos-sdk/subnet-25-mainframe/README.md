# SN25 - Mainframe

The Protein Folding API provides endpoints for submitting and managing protein folding jobs on the Bittensor network (Subnet 25). The API consists of two main components:

1. **Folding API** - For distributing protein folding jobs across multiple validators
2. **Organic API** - For submitting jobs directly to individual validators (restricted access)
