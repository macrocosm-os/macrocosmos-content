# Organic API

The Organic API provides an interface for submitting real-world protein folding tasks to the Folding subnet. Unlike synthetic validation tasks that are generated by validators, organic tasks are submitted externally by authorized clients and represent genuine scientific interest in specific protein structures. This document covers the API endpoints, authentication mechanism, architecture, and how organic jobs are processed within the system.

For information about the general Folding API for interacting with the subnet, see [folding-api](../folding-api/ "mention")



The API can be deployed in two ways:

1. **Same-process deployment**: The API runs within the validator process.
2. **Separate-process deployment**: The API runs in a dedicated process, communicating with the validator through a pipe.
